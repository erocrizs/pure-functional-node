# Pure Functional Node

A fun re-implementation of common pre-existing JavaScript functionalities
using pure functional programming approach. In JavaScript.

This library is inteded to be used for educational and recreational purposes
only. This isn't supposed to be used in-production because, honestly, why would
you? It's hella inefficient and un-optimized, both memory and speed-wise.

## The Oath

The developers are brave, lawful artisans upholding the principles of 
[functional programming][1] as based on the teachings of the [Old Church][2] of
[Lambda Calculus][3].

See OATH.md for more details.
