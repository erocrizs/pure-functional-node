# The Oath of the Developers

The developers are not merely barbarians who knows how to code. They bravely
uphold for their principles and uphold them in the face of any crisis. Like
paladins loyal to the oath they swore, developers are loyal to none other than
the higher good brought forth by functional programming.

Hence, developers uphold themselves to a strict standard: all actions they
will take and all code they will commit shall be in accordance with the
core virtues of functional programming.

1. All lines will either be a declaration or a function call.
2. Values can only either be a function, a number, a string, or a boolean.
3. All functions must return a value.
4. The variable shall never be reassigned with a different value.
5. All JS operators for allowed types that performs mutation shall not be used.
6. Only functions in lambda literal `() => {}` shall be honored.
7. Node's `require` functionality is allowed only at the top of the file.
8. Objects shall only be used for importing and exporting values.
9. A new rule may be added so long as it is compatible with the existing code.
10. Rules may be extended and ammended in the future by creating a new rule.
